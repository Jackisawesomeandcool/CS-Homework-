/**
 * A basic CSV reader.
 *
 * WARNING: This is a very simple file that parses only the most basic CSV files.
 * In particular, it does not handle quotes, so cell data cannot contain commas!!
 * (This will not matter for us in 331.)
 *
 * A CSV is a plain-text way to store spreadsheet-like data. Each line is one
 * row, and commas separate the fields within a row; the first line is often a
 * header naming the columns. For example:
 *
 *     name,quiz1,quiz2
 *     alice,8,9
 *     bob,10,7
 *
 * parseCsv turns such a file into a String[][] grid, where grid[r][c] is the text
 * in row r, column c (so grid[1][0] above is "alice"). Every cell is a String, so
 * if a column holds numbers it is up to the caller to convert them, e.g. with
 * Integer.parseInt.
